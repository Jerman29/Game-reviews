<h1 style="color:purple;">Fortnite</h1>

<p style="color:purple;">It’s easy to see why millions of players are starting to play
 Fortnite Battle Royale. 
 With the addicting Battle Royale rules like you only have one life and scavenging,
 but a cautious play isn’t rewarded, and its emphasis on gathering materials help/
save yourself or to confuse the enemy player.
 It forces the players into combat so the tension builds up.
 For many players it feels like they like a small spook that makes Fornite Battle Royale so fun to play. Here is a review 
 from my fellow classmate. I think that fortnite is a creative game where 
 there are many different gamemodes and I find the different gamemodes very creative. Furthermore, I like this game because the updates bring many 
 nice and game changing things to the game like the new weapons and also gives the game more personality like the different skins. I rate this 4.3 out of 5 stars.</p>
 <h1 style="color:beige;">PUBG</h1>
 
 <p style="color:beige;"> Player Unkown Battle Grounds or commonly known as Pubg. The "father" of H1Z1 and Fornite is the most
 realistic Battle Royale. The game puts together 100 palyer aganist each other in a winner takes all and 
 a kill or be killer situation.I my opinion is that this game is the most relistic Battle Royale game on the market. When I have played it 
 it feels like the game can have more varities like limited-gamemodes in Fornite and I think this is a good idea to add. Here is a reveiw of they game by a fellow classmate
  . The reason why I enjoy Player Unknown Batttle Grounds more than Fortnite Battle Royale is that there is more varity of weaponry. Also because of the large map there are vehicles that provide more content for the game making it 
     more entertaining and because of this if you play with a friend some vehicles such as the buggy has a gun mounted to the top so someone could be driving as your teamate shoots. I would give this game 4/5 stars as it has good 
     content but it should have a graphics upgrade in future updates. </p> 
    
 <h1 style="color:orange;">Far Cry 5</h1>
<p style="color:orange;"> As you may have know that Far cry 5 or FC 5 is a great game to watch and play. The games is based 
on the protagonist The Deputy or commonly knows as Rook or Rookie and the antagonists The Seed family which take control over the 
country folk and try to save the world from themselves. 
With gameplay with most content creators they have taken the initial
over view such as multiplayer to campaign. There is no way to miss out on speical dlcs or promotion packs because it if a new game on the market and many people are playing it. My review would be a 4
out of 5 stars because I think the the game could have more side missions and for looting system is like the more you loot the higher your progress will be. This is another review from a student in my class. The Farcry Series is known as you the 
    player are given choices to be a antagonist or a protaginist. In Farcry 5 there is a villian named </p>
